## 📸 How It Works

1. **Upload Your Photo** – Provide a clear image of yourself.
2. **Upload Clothing Image** – Choose any dress/shirt/pant image you want to try on.
3. **Get Results** – The app uses a backend API to overlay or blend the clothing onto your photo using AI.
4. **Download or Share** – Save the preview for personal use or share with friends.
